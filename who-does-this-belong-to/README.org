#+TITLE: Who Does This Belong To (250pts)

This challenge consisted of two parts: getting a shell via a simple
command-injection vulnerability in =diusweb= (straightforward), and
escalating privileges on the host via the =dius= compression utility
(PITA). Brian Welch posted a great writeup [[https://github.com/welchbj/ctf/tree/master/writeups/2020/CyberStakes/who-does-this-belong-to][here]].

- =libw.c=: Tiny C file to make a shared library with a constructor
  function that reads and prints the flag (this will be loaded by the
  =dius= binary while it is running set-uid =root=)
- =race.c=: Exploit race condition in =dius= to cause it to extract
  =libw.so= to =/challenge/www/c=
- =win.py=: Script to upload =libw.so= and =race= to target, when run the
  sequence of commands to get the flag

#+begin_src sh
$ python win.py <challenge host> <challenge port>
